# Desktop App with Flask... HOW?

Simply toggle on [this line](https://github.com/Zenahr/FlaskDesktopAppDaisyUITemplate/blob/5375799c5798465bb992f0eb5d1042e4f1e656c3/app.py#L16) and comment out [this line](https://github.com/Zenahr/FlaskDesktopAppDaisyUITemplate/blob/5375799c5798465bb992f0eb5d1042e4f1e656c3/app.py#L15) and start the app.py script. You should now see an OS-native window with the app running inside it.
